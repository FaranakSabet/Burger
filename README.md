# Burger

##Description:

This application is a burger logger created with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. It was designed the MVC pattern; Node and MySQL query and route data, and Handlebars generate the HTML. Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

Whenever a user submits a burger's name, this app displays the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.
Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.
My app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
